Scope
The purpose of this document is to define the scope of the measurement management system (MMS) for gas stations in accordance with ISO 10012:2003. The MMS aims to ensure that measurements related to fuel storage, dispensing, and other related activities at gas stations are accurate, reliable, and consistent with applicable regulations and standards.

The MMS will cover all aspects of measurement management, including:

Calibration of measurement equipment such as fuel dispensers, tanks, and other measurement devices.
Verification of measurement accuracy through periodic testing and inspection.
Maintenance of measurement equipment to ensure proper functioning and accuracy.
Training of personnel on proper measurement procedures and techniques.
Documentation and record keeping of measurement data and related activities.
Continuous improvement of the measurement management system through monitoring, analysis, and corrective actions.
The MMS will be implemented at all gas stations under the jurisdiction of the regulatory body responsible for overseeing measurement standards in the respective region.

The scope of this document includes the development and implementation of the MMS, as well as ongoing management, review, and improvement of the system. It does not cover the procurement, installation, or maintenance of specific measurement equipment or software, which will be the responsibility of the gas station operators.

The MMS will be subject to regular audits and reviews to ensure compliance with ISO 10012:2003 and other relevant standards and regulations.

The objective of the MMS is to provide accurate and reliable measurements that meet the needs of all stakeholders, including customers, gas station operators, regulatory bodies, and other interested parties. The MMS will contribute to the overall safety, quality, and efficiency of fuel management at gas stations, and will help to minimize the risks associated with inaccurate or unreliable measurements.
