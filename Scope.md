# Scope

The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the measurement management system (MMS) for gas stations in accordance with ISO 10012:2003. The MMS aims to ensure that measurements related to fuel storage, dispensing, and other related activities at gas stations are accurate, reliable, and consistent with applicable regulations and standards.

The scope of the MMS includes the following:

- Calibration of measurement equipment such as fuel dispensers, tanks, and other measurement devices.
- Verification of measurement accuracy through periodic testing and inspection.
- Maintenance of measurement equipment to ensure proper functioning and accuracy.
- Training of personnel on proper measurement procedures and techniques.
- Documentation and record keeping of measurement data and related activities.
- Continuous improvement of the measurement management system through monitoring, analysis, and corrective actions.

The MMS will be implemented at all gas stations under the jurisdiction of the regulatory body responsible for overseeing measurement standards in the respective region. The objective of the MMS is to provide accurate and reliable measurements that meet the needs of all stakeholders, including customers, gas station operators, regulatory bodies, and other interested parties.

The MMS will be subject to regular audits and reviews to ensure compliance with ISO 10012:2003 and other relevant standards and regulations. The audits will be conducted by internal and external auditors to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the MMS.

The management of the MMS will be responsible for ensuring that the MMS is maintained and updated to reflect changes in regulations and standards. This will be done through regular review and monitoring of the MMS to identify areas for improvement and to ensure that the MMS remains effective and relevant.

We hope that this scope page will serve as a useful resource for all stakeholders involved in the measurement management system for gas stations.
